## The Objective

This WPF project is a open source representation of my last xBot project made on WinForm (C#) a few months ago.
In fact, the code can result a bit messy and extensive, but please consider this is my WPF-learning project.
I'm not entirelly sure if the source release will be a good choice since always will exists a people looking for taking abusive advantajes over others which is not my intention, mine is simple; making a modern bot that will be better than sBot and/or mBot and will be available for free obviously.
